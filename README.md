##  Key Sections & Verified Features

- ** Interactive 3D Developer Desk**: A procedurally modelled laptop (no external model files) on a graphite desk. The lid opens and the screen boots into **Faysal OS** — a real, scrollable HTML screen locked onto the 3D display, built live from `data.js`. The tabs under the laptop (Home, About, Projects, Skills, Research, Leadership, Terminal) switch what the screen shows; Projects is a scrollable image gallery whose Details buttons open the full project modal, and Terminal includes a working contact form. Power, focus and reset controls sit outside the laptop; turning the display off never affects the website itself. Lighter rendering on phones, reduced-motion support, and a static fallback when WebGL is unavailable.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Running Locally

Since Python 3 is installed on your computer, you can preview the website locally anytime:

1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ASUS\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\portfolio-3d
   ```

2. Start a local server:
   ```powershell
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```text
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   *(Or simply double-click `index.html` in your file explorer!)*

## 🌐 How to Deploy to GitHub Pages (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
2. Name your repository (e.g., `portfolio` or `faysal-portfolio`).
3. Set the repository visibility to **Public**.
4. Leave "Add a README file" unchecked and click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Push your files to GitHub
Open PowerShell in the `portfolio-3d` directory and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\ASUS\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\portfolio-3d

# Initialize git repository
git init
git branch -M main

# Add all files and make initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Faysal Mahmud 3D CSE Web Portfolio"

# Link to your new GitHub repository (replace with your actual GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages in 3 Clicks
1. On your GitHub repository page, click **Settings** (top tab bar).
2. On the left sidebar under *Code and automation*, click **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select `Deploy from a branch`.
   - **Branch**: Select `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Click **Save**.
5. In under 60 seconds, your site is live at:
   `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/`

## 🔐 How to Add Your GitHub Links & Real URLs

When you are ready to link your GitHub repos, LinkedIn profile, or publication DOIs:

### Method 1: Using the Built-In Admin Portal (Recommended)
1. Run the portfolio on your PC with a local server (for example VS Code **Live Server**, or `python -m http.server 8000`) and open it at `http://localhost`. Double-clicking `index.html` can't read `.env`.
2. Press **`Ctrl + Shift + A`** (or click the lock icon in the footer/navbar).
3. Enter the password from your `.env` file and click **Unlock CMS**.
4. In the **Portfolio Control Center**:
   - **👤 Profile & Picture**: Paste your GitHub profile URL, LinkedIn URL, or upload a custom photo.
   - **🚀 Projects Showcase**: Click **Edit** on any project (e.g. NextTrip, FlowSense, Bank Management) and paste the GitHub repository link.
   - **📦 GitHub Sync & Export**: Click **"Download Updated data.js"**.
5. Move the downloaded `data.js` into your `portfolio-3d/js/` folder.
6. Commit & push:
   ```powershell
   git add js/data.js
   git commit -m "Add GitHub repository links"
   git push
   ```

### 🔑 Admin Password
- Your password lives in **`.env`** (next to `index.html`) as `ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password`. To change it, edit that one line and save. That's all.
- `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so it is **never committed or pushed**. Only `.env.example` (a placeholder) is committed.
- **The live site has no admin login at all.** GitHub Pages never receives `.env`, and the editor buttons are hidden unless the site runs on `localhost`. Visitors can't log in, and even if someone forced the editor open in their own browser, changes would only affect their own copy. The live site changes only when **you** push a new `js/data.js`, so your GitHub account is the real protection.
- Before every commit, run `git status` and make sure `.env` is **not** listed.

### Method 2: Direct File Editing
Open [`js/data.js`](file:///C:/Users/ASUS/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/portfolio-3d/js/data.js) in your code editor, fill in the `github` and `demo` fields, save, and push to GitHub.
